# orbit-chain-proof-stack

`orbit-chain-proof-stack` explores blockchain tooling in C. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Orbit Chain Proof Stack Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Implementation Notes

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The C implementation keeps headers, source, and assertions separate so bounds and types are easy to review.

## Why This Exists

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Feature Notes

- Uses fixture data to keep event replay changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for invariant checks, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents settlement rules tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Example Scenarios

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Local Setup

The only required setup is the local C toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Boundaries

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Roadmap

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more blockchain tooling fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
